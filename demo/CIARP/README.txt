Brief:

This script executes the Dynamic Trees method for image segmentation proposed in [1] 
with minor implementation changes, the distance between nodes are defined by the 
squared l2 norm and a new gamma scale parameter for neighbor nodes distance is introduced.
Equivalent results are obtained while introducing more flexibility.

Dataset obtained from the paper [2].

Requirements:

* PyIFT


Example:

python3 execute-dataset.py
